# CountingSpaceOnTheConsole
counting areas on the map created with 1 and 0 on the console

A representative map is created on the console.
1's represent the border line and 0's represent areas on the map.
In practice, regions on the representative map are counted.
It was developed with the Dev-C ++ program.
Map drawing operations are done randomly.
